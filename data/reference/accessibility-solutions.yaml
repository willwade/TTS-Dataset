notes:
- Handcrafted compatibility matrix for accessibility products.
- 'Support levels: native, compatible, possible, unsupported, unknown.'
- A solution can support runtime interfaces (e.g. SAPI5/AVSynth) and/or official provider SDK integrations.
- Claims should be treated as operational guidance and validated against vendor docs/licenses per release.
- 'Scope: software solutions (apps/platforms), not every hardware device SKU.'
- Browser speech runtimes are broker layers and may route to OS or vendor-specific voices depending on
  browser/OS.
- 'runtime_class values: direct (runtime is synthesis endpoint), broker (runtime routes to other engines/providers).'
- Merge candidate generated from temp/accessibility-solutions.cleaned.yaml
- Base entries preserved; additive changes only for overlapping solution IDs.
- Merged additive updates from temp/accessibility-solutions-temp.yaml (no deletions).
