notes:
  - "Handcrafted compatibility matrix for accessibility products."
  - "Support levels: native, compatible, possible, unsupported, unknown."
  - "A solution can support runtime interfaces (e.g. SAPI5/AVSynth) and/or official provider SDK integrations."
  - "Claims should be treated as operational guidance and validated against vendor docs/licenses per release."
  - "Scope: software solutions (apps/platforms), not every hardware device SKU."
  - "Browser speech runtimes are broker layers and may route to OS or vendor-specific voices depending on browser/OS."
  - "runtime_class values: direct (runtime is synthesis endpoint), broker (runtime routes to other engines/providers)."
